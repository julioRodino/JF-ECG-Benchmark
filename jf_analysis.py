JF analysis
============
Analyses a detector for Jitter and F1 score.
At the heart is the jitter detection algorithm on annotation/detection
pairs. A Jitter of 0ms gives a 100% score and then drops to
zero with increased jitter.
Missed beats and extra/spurios detections are then used to calculate F1
as a normalised measure independent on the number of beats.
The overall score is then: jf = Jitter/% * F1/%.
