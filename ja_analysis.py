"""
JA analysis
============
Analyses a detector for Jitter and Accuracy.
At the heart is the jitter detection algorithm on annotation/detection
pairs. A Jitter of 0ms gives a 100% score and then drops to
zero with increased jitter.
Missed beats and extra/spurios detections are then used to calculate Accuracy
as a normalised measure independent on the number of beats.
The overall score is then: JA = Jitter/% * Accuracy/%.
